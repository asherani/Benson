Avenues to go down:

	things to optimize for:
				- # of people
				- people "passionate about increasing women in tech" (from proposal email)
				- "building awareness and outreach" (from proposal email)
				- locations where people are more likely to stop and give contact info 
	



	variables to consider:
				- what can act as proxies for the bottom three things to optimize for above?

				- does more women entering a station lead to optimization of any of the above?
					- can demographics of surrounding neighborhoods act as a proxy for "how many women are using this station relative to other stations?"
