# BENSON PROJECT - TEAM ABA

## 2018.09.24

### Team

* AIMAN
* BEN

* ARI

### Opportunity

<u>Stakeholder</u>: WTWY International

<u>Customer Verbatim</u>: "help us optimize the placement of our street teams"

<u>Objective</u>: Maximize Signatures

### Problem Statement

WTWY requests of team ABA to be able to provide insight as to the most optimal placement of their limited street team resources to maximize signatures and thereby maximize their potential pool of Gala attendees.

### Methodology

Based on the Design Thinking and Iterative Process, we start with the End User WTWY International request of helping to optimize the placement of their street team. The MVP we have come up with is to detertmine those MTA stations with the Highest Mean Ridership per day.

Once this MVP is complete we plan to Iterate by:

* Parsing, filtering, and merging data sets that can help us stratify along the following:
  * Granularity in Space: Neighborhoods, Rail Lines, Counties, Lat/Lon
  * Granularity in Time: Morning/Evening, Time Segments, Hourly, Weekday/Weekend

* Better understand ridership means by comparing:
  * Summary Statistics: Min/Max, Stdev, Variance, Range, Mean/Median/Mode, IQR
  * Additional Analysis: Correlations

* Exploratroy unknowns:
  * Other ways to operationalize optimization besides "Mean Ridership"
  * Additional datasets
