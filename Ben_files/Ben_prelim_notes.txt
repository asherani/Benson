Avenues to go down:

	things to optimize for:
				- # of people
				- people "passionate about increasing women in tech" (from proposal email)
				- "building awareness and outreach" (from proposal email)
				- locations where people are more likely to stop and give contact info 
	



	variables to consider:
				- what can act as proxies for the bottom three things to optimize?

				- does more women entering a station lead to optimization of any of the above?
					- can demographics of surrounding neighborhoods act as a proxy for "how many women are using this station relative to other stations?"
					- can we make assumptions about which stations are going to have a higher proportion of women at regular, specific times?

				- means of stations at same time across days of week (9-1 through 9-5 or whatever)
				- means of stations at same time across same day in different weeks (Monday 9-1, Monday 9-8, Monday 9-15 etc)
				- variances of stations at same time across days of week 
				- variances of stations at same time across same day in different weeks
				- means of stations in close proximity to one another (cluster stations somehow?)
				- variance of stations in close proximity to one another (cluster stations somehow?)
				- see if daily usage is correlated among any stations
				
	

	Other data to consider:
				
				- weather data
					- dummy variables of raining or not at time t, chance of rain time t + x hours, temp at time t, temp at time t + x hours  

				- get summary data about transit usage from elsewhere to act as assumptions for bucketing / modeling?
					- eg "60% of MTA traffic in midtown stations occurs between 7am-10am and 4pm-7pm"
				-

Done so far:
	- started data cleaning python file
	- determined station values not the same in station and ridership datasets
	- got weather data 
	- got documentation for station dataset, saved in repo


Current questions:
	- what are variables / values in ridership dataset

next steps:
	- find out what variables / values are
	- look at means / variances / correlations as outlined above
